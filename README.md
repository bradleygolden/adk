# ADK - Agent Development Kit for Elixir

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository was almost entirely generated by Claude AI and is highly experimental. Use at your own risk.

A powerful framework for building, running, and managing intelligent agents in Elixir, implementing the core architecture of Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) with idiomatic Elixir and OTP.

## Features

- **Agent Abstraction** - Multiple agent types for different use cases:
  - **Sequential Agents**: Execute steps in order with results flowing between steps
  - **Parallel Agents**: Run operations concurrently for high-performance tasks
  - **Loop Agents**: Repeat actions until specific conditions are met
  - **LLM Agents**: Use language models for reasoning and decision-making
  
- **Tool System** - Plugin architecture for agents to interact with external systems:
  - Behavior-based interface for easy tool creation
  - Automatic tool registration and discovery
  - Structured parameter and response handling
  
- **Memory Services** - Persistent state across interactions:
  - Short-term memory within agent sessions
  - Long-term memory via pluggable storage backends
  - Memory search and retrieval capabilities
  
- **Agent Orchestration** - Powerful composition patterns:
  - Hierarchical agent relationships
  - Delegation to specialized sub-agents
  - Cross-agent communication
  
- **OTP Architecture** - Built on Elixir's concurrency model:
  - Process isolation for fault tolerance
  - Supervisor trees for reliability
  - GenServer-based state management
  
- **A2A Protocol** - Agent-to-Agent communication:
  - Local inter-agent messaging
  - HTTP-based remote agent interaction
  - Standardized message format

## Installation

Add `adk` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:adk, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Sequential Agent

```elixir
# Create a tool
defmodule MyApp.Tools.Weather do
  use Adk.Tool
  
  @impl true
  def definition do
    %{
      name: "weather",
      description: "Get the weather for a location",
      parameters: %{
        location: %{
          type: "string",
          description: "The location to get weather for"
        }
      }
    }
  end
  
  @impl true
  def execute(%{"location" => location}) do
    # In a real implementation, you would call a weather API
    {:ok, "The weather in #{location} is sunny."}
  end
end

# Register the tool
Adk.register_tool(MyApp.Tools.Weather)

# Create a sequential agent
{:ok, agent} = Adk.create_agent(:sequential, %{
  name: "weather_agent",
  steps: [
    %{
      type: "tool",
      tool: "weather",
      params: %{"location" => "London"}
    }
  ]
})

# Run the agent
{:ok, result} = Adk.run(agent, "What's the weather in London?")
IO.puts(result.output)
```

### LLM-driven Agent

```elixir
# Register tools
Adk.register_tool(MyApp.Tools.Weather)
Adk.register_tool(Adk.Tools.MemoryTool)

# Create an LLM agent
{:ok, agent} = Adk.create_agent(:llm, %{
  name: "assistant",
  llm_provider: :openai,
  llm_options: %{model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"},
  system_prompt: "You are a helpful assistant with access to weather info and memory",
  tools: ["weather", "memory_tool"]
})

# Run the agent
{:ok, result} = Adk.run(agent, "What's the weather in London? Remember this for later.")

# The agent will use the weather tool to get the information and
# the memory tool to store it for future reference
```

### Multi-Agent System with Memory

```elixir
# Create specialized agents
{:ok, weather_agent} = Adk.create_agent(:llm, %{
  name: :weather_specialist,
  tools: ["weather"]
})

{:ok, travel_agent} = Adk.create_agent(:llm, %{
  name: :travel_specialist,
  tools: ["flights", "hotels"]
})

# Create a coordinator agent
{:ok, coordinator} = Adk.create_agent(:sequential, %{
  name: :trip_planner,
  steps: [
    %{type: "agent", agent: :weather_specialist},
    %{type: "agent", agent: :travel_specialist},
    %{
      type: "function",
      function: fn results ->
        # Store the final plan in memory
        user_id = "user_123"
        Adk.add_to_memory(:in_memory, user_id, results)
        
        # Return formatted results
        "Trip planned! Weather and travel arrangements confirmed."
      end
    }
  ]
})

# Run the coordinator agent
{:ok, result} = Adk.run(coordinator, "Plan a trip to Paris next week")
```

## Agent Types

The ADK supports several types of agents:

- **Sequential**: Executes a series of steps in order, passing results between steps
- **Parallel**: Executes multiple tasks concurrently for improved performance
- **Loop**: Repeats actions until a condition is met
- **LLM**: Uses language models for decision making and tool selection

## Tools

Tools are the primary way for agents to interact with the world. The ADK provides a simple interface for creating and registering tools that can be used by agents.

## Memory

The Memory service allows agents to store and retrieve information across sessions or interactions:

```elixir
# Store information
Adk.add_to_memory(:in_memory, "user_123", "Important information")

# Retrieve stored information
{:ok, sessions} = Adk.get_memory(:in_memory, "user_123")

# Search memory
{:ok, results} = Adk.search_memory(:in_memory, "user_123", "important")
```

## Agent-to-Agent Communication

Agents can communicate with each other either locally or remotely:

```elixir
# Call a local agent
{:ok, result} = Adk.call_agent(weather_agent, "What's the weather in Paris?")

# Make an agent available via HTTP
Adk.expose_agent(weather_agent, "/agents/weather")

# Call a remote agent
{:ok, result} = Adk.call_remote_agent("https://weather-service.example.com/run", 
                                     "What's the weather in Paris?")
```

## Architectural Design

ADK for Elixir follows a modular design based on OTP principles:

```
